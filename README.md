# String-Calculator.infix-to-postfix-convertion.postfix-calculation
A program that contains a tokenizer function that converts the input string(infix) to a vector of strings , a convertToPostfix function that converts the vector that comes from the tokenizer to a postfix vector, a postfixCalculator that handles the calculation of a postfix expression, and a few useful functions like isOperator and so on. Did my best to have a clean code, feel free to submit issues or anything else.
